@REM   	This is a Windows build script to compile the PRT Exporter for Houdini 12 or Houdini 13.

@REM   	This program must be launched from the "Houdini Command Line Tools".
@REM 	You will need to link with PRT-IO-Library Reference Library. It can be downloaded from the Thinkbox Github.
@REM   	You will need to link with OpenEXR and Zlib Libaries. Normally, those libraries are included in your Houdini install directory.
@REM	This build file assumes PRT-IO-Library is in the user's home directory and that %HFS% points to your Houdini install directory. Please modify this as needed.

hcustom -I %userprofile%\PRT-IO-Library\ -I %HFS%\toolkit\include\OpenEXR\ -I %HFS%\toolkit\include\zlib -L %HFS%\custom\houdini\dsolib\ -l Half.lib -g exportPRT.cpp
